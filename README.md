# LogicSim
Binary logic simulation program. Maybe it will be something better.

# How it works

## Basic structure
A circuit consists of components.
Each component is an element or a connector.
An element has input and output ports.
Input ports are connected to output ports via connectors.
An element can be an input, an output or a regular element.

## Input and output
For now only a console input is available.

## Regular elements
For now only basic binary logic gates are available.

## Circuits
A circuit has a set of input and outputs.
Each circuit automatically handles update routines of components located between inputs and outputs.
